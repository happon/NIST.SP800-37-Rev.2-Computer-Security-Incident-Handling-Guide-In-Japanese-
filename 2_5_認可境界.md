## 2.5 AUTHORIZATION BOUNDARIES
## 2.5 認可境界

The authorization boundary establishes the scope of protection for an information system (i.e., what the organization agrees to protect under its direct management or within the scope of its responsibilities).41 The authorization boundary includes the people, processes, and information technologies (i.e., system elements) that are part of each system supporting the　organization’s missions and business functions. Authorization boundaries that are too expansive (i.e., includetoo many system elements or components) make the risk management process unnecessarily complex. Conversely, authorization boundaries that are too limited (i.e., include too few system elements or components) increase the number of systems that must be separately managed and therefore, may unnecessarily inflate the information security and privacy costs for the organization.  




The authorization boundary for a system is established during the RMF Prepare Task – System level, Task P-11. Organizations have flexibility in determining what constitutes the　authorization boundary for a system. The set of system elements included within an authorization boundary　defines the system (i.e., the scope of the　authorization). When a set of system elements is identified as an authorization boundary for a　system, the elements are generally under the same direct management.42 Other considerations for determining the authorization boundary include identifying system elements that:  

システムの認可境界は、RMFの準備タスク ― システムレベルにおけるタスクP-11において定められる。
組織は、システムの認可境界を構成する要素を柔軟に定義できる。認可境界に設定されたシステム要素の集合が、すなわちそのシステム（すなわち認可の範囲）を意味する。あるシステムに対して認可境界として特定された要素群は、一般に同一の直接的な管理下に置かれている。
認可境界を決定する際には、以下のようなシステム要素の特定も考慮すべきである：

- Support the same mission or business functions; 
- Have similar operating characteristics and security and privacy requirements; 
- Process, store, and transmit similar types of information (e.g., categorized at the same impact level);43 or
- Reside in the same environment of operation (or in the case of a distributed system, reside in various locations with similar operating environments).  

- 同一の使命または事業機能を担っている
- 運用特性やセキュリティ・プライバシー要件が類似している
- 同種の情報（例：同一の影響度区分に分類される情報）を処理・保存・送信している
- 同一の運用環境に存在している（分散システムの場合は、類似した運用環境にある複数拠点に分散している）


The scope of the authorization boundary is revisited periodically as part of the continuous monitoring process carried out by the organization. While the above considerations may be useful to organizations in determining authorization boundaries for purposes of managing risk, the considerations are not intended to limit the organization’s flexibility in establishing authorization boundaries that promote effective security and privacy with the available resources of the organization.

The process of establishing authorization boundaries carries significant risk management implications and is therefore an organization-wide activity that requires coordination among key participants. The process considers mission and business requirements, security and privacy requirements, and the costs to the organization. Appendix G provides additional information and considerations for determining authorization boundaries, including boundaries for complex systems and software applications.

**EFFECTIVE AUTHORIZATION BOUNDARIES**

Establishing meaningful authorization boundaries for systems and common controls is one of the most important risk management activities carried out by an organization. The authorization boundary defines the specific scope of an authorizing official’s responsibility and accountability for protecting information resources and individuals’ privacy—including the use of systems, components, and services from external providers. Establishment of meaningful authorization boundaries is a foundation for assuring mission and business success for the organization.
