** OMB CIRCULAR A-130: INTEGRATION OF INFORMATION SECURITY AND PRIVACY **

In 2016, OMB revised Circular A-130, the circular establishing general policy for the planning, 
budgeting, governance, acquisition, and management of federal information, personnel, 
equipment, funds, information technology resources, and supporting infrastructure and 
services. The circular addresses responsibilities for protecting federal information resources and managing personally identifiable information (PII). In establishing requirements for information security programs and privacy programs, the circular emphasizes the need for both programs to collaborate on shared objectives:  
* While security and privacy are independent and separate disciplines, they are closely related, 
and it is essential for agencies to take a coordinated approach to identifying and managing security and privacy risks and complying with applicable requirements. *
[OMB A-130] requires organizations to implement the RMF that is described in this guideline. 
With the 2016 revision to the circular, OMB also requires organizations to integrate privacy into the RMF process:  

* The RMF provides a disciplined and structured process that integrates information security, 
privacy, and risk management activities into the SDLC. This Circular requires organizations to 
use the RMF to manage privacy risks beyond those that are typically included under the 
“confidentiality” objective of the term “information security.” While many privacy risks relate to the unauthorized access or disclosure of PII, privacy risks may also result from other activities, including the creation, collection, use, and retention of PII; the inadequate quality or integrity of PII; and the lack of appropriate notice, transparency, or participation. *  

This section of the guideline describes the relationship between information security programs and privacy programs under the RMF. However, subject to OMB policy, organizations retain theflexibility to undertake the integration of privacy into the RMF in the most effective manner, considering the organization’s mission and circumstances.

Executing the RMF requires close collaboration between information security programs and 
privacy programs. While information security programs and privacy programs have different 
objectives, those objectives are overlapping and complementary. Information security programs 
are responsible for protecting information and information systems from unauthorized access, 
use, disclosure, disruption, modification, or destruction (i.e., unauthorized system activity or behavior) in order to provide confidentiality, integrity, and availability. Privacy programs are responsible for ensuring compliance with applicable privacy requirements and for managing the risks to individuals associated with the creation, collection, use, processing, dissemination,storage, maintenance, disclosure, or disposal (collectively referred to as “processing”) of PII.30
When preparing to execute the steps of the RMF, organizations consider how to best promote and institutionalize collaboration between the two programs to ensure that the objectives of both disciplines are met at every step of the process.  


When an information system processes PII, the organization’s information security program and 
privacy program have a shared responsibility for managing the risks to individuals that may arise from unauthorized system activity or behavior. This requires the two programs to collaborate 
when selecting, implementing, assessing, and monitoring security controls.31 However, while 
information security programs and privacy programs have complementary objectives with 
respect to managing the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of PII, protecting individuals’ privacy cannot be achieved solely by securing PII.

Not all privacy risks arise from unauthorized system activity or behavior, such as unauthorized access or disclosure of PII. Some privacy risks may result from authorized activity that is beyond the scope of information security. For example, privacy programs are responsible for managing the risks to individuals that may result from the creation, collection, use, and retention of PII; the inadequate quality or integrity of PII; and the lack of appropriate notice, transparency, or participation. Therefore, to help ensure compliance with applicable privacy requirements and to manage privacy risks from authorized and unauthorized processing of PII, organizations’ privacy programs also select, implement, assess, and monitor privacy controls.32

[OMB A-130] defines a privacy control as an administrative, technical, or physical safeguard employed within an agency to ensure compliance with applicable privacy requirements and to 
manage privacy risks. A privacy control is different from a security control, which the Circular defines as a safeguard or countermeasure prescribed for an information system or an 
organization to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the system and its information. Due to the shared responsibility that organizations’ information security programs and privacy programs have to manage the risks to individuals arising from unauthorized system 
activity or behavior, controls that achieve both security and privacy objectives are both privacy and security controls. This guideline refers to such controls that achieve both sets of objectives simply as “controls.” When this guideline uses the descriptors “privacy” and “security” with the term control, it is referring to those controls in circumstances where the controls are selected, implemented, and assessed for particular objectives.

The risk management processes described in this publication are equally applicable to security and privacy programs. However, the risks that security and privacy programs are required to manage are overlapping in some areas, but not in others. Consequently, it is important that organizations understand the interplay between privacy and security to promote effective collaboration between privacy and security officials at every level of the organization.
