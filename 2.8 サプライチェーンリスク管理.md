## 2.8 SUPPLY CHAIN RISK MANAGEMENT
## 2.8 サプライチェーンリスク管理

Organizations are becoming increasingly reliant on products, systems, and services provided by 
external providers to carry out missions and business functions. Organizations are responsible 
and accountable for the risk incurred when using such component products, systems, and 
services.46 Relationships with external providers can be established in a variety of ways, for 
example, through joint ventures, business partnerships, various types of formal agreements 
(e.g., contracts, interagency agreements, lines of business arrangements, licensing agreements), 
or outsourcing arrangements.

The growing dependence on products, systems, and services from external providers, along with
the nature of the relationships with those providers, present an increasing amount of risk to an 
organization. Risk may increase based on the likelihood of occurrence and adverse impact from 
threat events such as the insertion of counterfeits, unauthorized production, tampering, theft, 
insertion of malicious software and hardware, as well as poor manufacturing and development 
practices in the supply chain, including the failure to build in security or privacy capabilities that 
enable an organization to better manage risk in its environment.


Supply chain risks can be endemic or systemic within a system element, system, organization, 
sector, or nation. While the singular use of a system element or service within a system may 
present an acceptable risk to an organization, its common or extended use throughout a system, 
organization, sector or nation can raise the risk to an unacceptable level. These risks are often 
associated with the global and distributed nature of product and service supply chains and an 
organization’s decreased visibility into, and understanding of, how the technology that they 
acquire is developed, integrated, and deployed. This includes the processes, procedures, and 
practices used to assure the integrity, security, resilience, privacy capabilities, and quality of the 
acquired products, systems, and services.　

To address supply chain risks, organizations develop an SCRM policy, which is an important
vehicle for directing SCRM activities. Guided and informed by applicable laws, executive orders, 
directives, policies, and regulations, the SCRM policy supports applicable organizational policies 
(e.g., acquisition and procurement, information security and privacy, logistics, quality, and 
supply chain). The policy addresses the goals and objectives in the organization’s strategic plan, 
missions and business functions, and the internal and external customer requirements. It also 
defines the integration points for SCRM with the risk management and the SDLC processes for 
the organization. Finally, the SCRM policy defines the SCRM roles and responsibilities within the 
organization, any dependencies among those roles, and the interaction among the roles. SCRM 
roles specify the responsibilities for procurement, conducting risk assessments, collecting supply 
chain threat intelligence, identifying and implementing risk-based mitigations, and performing 
monitoring functions.

[FISMA] and [OMB A-130] require external providers handling federal information or operating 
systems on behalf of the federal government to meet the same security and privacy 
requirements as federal agencies. Security and privacy requirements for external providers 
including the controls for systems processing, storing, or transmitting federal information are 
expressed in contracts or other formal agreements. The RMF can be effectively used to manage 
supply chain risk.47 The conceptual view of the system in Figure 5 can guide and inform security, 
privacy, and risk management activities for all elements of the supply chain. Every step in the 
RMF can be executed by nonfederal external providers except for the Authorize step—that is, 
the acceptance of risk is an inherent federal responsibility for which senior executives are held 
responsible and accountable. The authorization decision is directly linked to the management of 
risk related to the acquisition and use of component products, systems, and services from 
external providers.48 [OMB A-130] also requires organizations to develop and implement SCRM
plans.49


Managing supply chain risk is a complex, multifaceted undertaking requiring a coordinated 
effort across an organization—building trust relationships and communicating with both internal 
and external stakeholders. SCRM activities involve identifying and assessing applicable risks, 
determining appropriate mitigating actions, developing appropriate SCRM plans to document 
selected mitigating actions, and monitoring performance against SCRM plans. Because supply 
chains differ across and within organizations, SCRM plans are tailored to the individual program, 
organizational, and operational contexts. Tailored plans provide the basis for determining 
whether a system is “fit for purpose” and as such, the controls need to be tailored accordingly. 
Tailored SCRM plans help organizations to focus their resources on the most critical missions 
and business functions based on mission and business requirements and their risk environment.


The determination that the risk from acquiring products, systems, or services from external 
providers is acceptable depends on the level of assurance50 that the organization can gain from 
the providers. The level of assurance is based on the degree of control the organization can 
exert on the external provider regarding the controls needed for the protection of the product, 
system, or service and the evidence brought forth by the provider as to the effectiveness of 
those controls.

The degree of control is established by the specific terms and conditions of the contract or 
service-level agreement. Some organizations have extensive control through contract vehicles or 
other agreements that specify the security and privacy requirements for the external provider. 
Other organizations, in contrast, have limited control because they are purchasing commodity services or commercial off-the-shelf products. The level of assurance can also be based on many 
other factors that convince the organization that the requisite controls have been implemented 
and that a credible determination of control effectiveness exists. For example, an authorized 
external cloud service provided to an organization through a well-established line-of-business 
relationship may provide a level of trust in the service that is within the risk tolerance of the 
organization. Ultimately, the responsibility for responding to risks from the use of component 
products, systems, and services from external providers remains with the organization and the 
authorizing official. Organizations require that an appropriate chain of trust be established with 
external providers when dealing with the issues associated with system security or privacy risks.

**SUPPLY CHAIN RISK MANAGEMENT STRATEGIES AND PLANS**
Organizations have flexibility on how the details of SCRM strategies and plans are documented. 
SCRM strategy details for Levels 1 and 2 (organization and mission/business process levels), can 
be documented in the information security program plan for the organization or in a separate 
organization-level and/or mission/business process-level SCRM strategy. SCRM plan details for 
Level 3 (information system level) can be documented in the information system security plan
or in a separate system-level SCRM plan. An SCRM strategy template is provided in [SP 800-161].
